       "'Here is a precise summary of the speech in French:\\n\\n« Les personnes de tout le pays, impliquées dans les activités gouvernementales, politiques et sociales, se consacrent à rendre le \"Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra\" (Voyage de Résolution pour un Inde Développée) réussi. En tant que parlementaire, il était mon devoir de contribuer à ce programme. Aujourd\\'hui, je suis venu ici en tant que parlementaire et votre serviteur, prêt à participer à ce programme, comme vous.\\n\\nDans notre pays, les gouvernements sont venus et partis, de nombreux schémas ont été élaborés, des discussions ont eu lieu et de grandes promesses ont été faites. Cependant, mon expérience et mes observations m\\'ont conduit à croire que le plus important est d\\'assurer que les plans du gouvernement atteignent les bénéficiaires destinataires sans difficulté. Si il y a un \"Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana\" (Système de logements du Premier Ministre), alors les personnes vivant dans des bidonvilles et des slums doivent obtenir leur maison. Et il ne devrait pas falloir qu\\'il se rende dans les bureaux gouvernementaux pour cela. Le gouvernement devrait aller jusqu\\'à lui.\\n\\nCe \"Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra\" est, en quelque sorte, mon propre examen. Je veux entendre vos expériences avec les programmes gouvernementaux et comprendre si les bénéficiaires ont reçu les avantages prévus sans avoir à payer de pots-de-vin. Nous obtiendrons une image réelle si nous les visitons à nouveau.\\n\\nIl est essentiel de vérifier si le travail qui devait se produire s\\'est effectivement produit. J\\'ai récemment rencontré des individus qui ont utilisé la carte Ayushman pour obtenir des soins médicaux pour des maladies graves. L\\'un d\\'eux a eu un accident grave et, après avoir utilisé la carte, il a pu se faire opérer et maintenant il se rétablit bien. Lorsque je l\\'ai interrogé, il a dit : \"Comment aurais-je pu me permettre ce traitement ? Maintenant que la carte Ayushman est disponible, j\\'ai trouvé le courage de subir une opération. Maintenant, je vais bien.\"\\n\\nCes histoires sont des bienfaits pour moi.\\n\\nLes bureaucrates, qui préparent de bons schémas, accélèrent le traitement des dossiers et allouent des fonds, se sentent également satisfaits lorsque 50 ou 100 personnes qui devaient obtenir des fonds les ont reçus. Lorsqu\\'ils voient les résultats tangibles de leurs efforts, leur enthousiasme multiplie. Ils se sentent satisfaits. C\\'est pourquoi le \"Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra\" a eu un impact positif sur les fonctionnaires. Il leur a donné plus d\\'enthousiasme pour leur travail, surtout lorsque ils voient les avantages tangibles atteindre les gens. Les fonctionnaires se sentent satisfaits, disant : \"J\\'ai fait un plan bon, j\\'ai créé un fichier, et les bénéficiaires destinataires ont reçu les avantages.\" Lorsqu\\'ils entendent des histoires comme celles-ci, ils se sentent très satisfaits. »\\n\\nNote: I translated \"Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra\" as \"Voyage de Résolution pour un Inde Développée\", as it seems to be a national program aimed at developing India. If you have any specific requirements or preferences for the translation, please let me know.'"

Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a question from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and assured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work'),\n",

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Let me now share with you, the enriching experience I had, whil e meeting more than \\n6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories visitin g Rashtrapati Bhavan. \\nThey evinced keen interest in the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens , the Spiritual \\nGarden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden and interact \\nwith the Horticultural specialists. Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautiful experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens.

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs.

      "Speech : Here is a summary of the departing speech of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam:\n",
      "\n",
      "Former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is addressing the nation, expressing gratitude to everyone he has worked with during his 5-year tenure in Rashtrapati Bhavan. He reflects on his experiences and shares 10 important messages that he wants to convey to the people of India. These messages include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Accelerating development to fulfill the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "* Empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "* Developing a strong agricultural sector (Seed to Food)\n",
      "* Overcoming problems through partnership\n",
      "* Showing courage in the face of calamities\n",
      "* Fostering connectivity for societal transformation\n",
      "* Defending the nation\n",
      "* Creating a youth movement to achieve a Developed India by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "He shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti, who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation before 2020. Kalam appreciated her question and assured her that he would work towards making India a developed nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and acknowledged it as thoughtful. They assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution in the nation and that they would work towards making it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the aspirations of Indian youth and the desire to live in a developed India. The speaker, who is the President of India, reflects on their experience visiting a village in Nagaland where they saw a empowered village council functioning effectively. The speaker believes that if all 600,000 villages in India are empowered to manage their own development and are well-connected with urban areas, a transformation can take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also highlights an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which provides urban amenities in rural areas through a PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex. This complex includes provision of physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic connectivity and has resulted in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the success of the Periyar PURA (Participatory Urban-Rural Action) initiative in Thanjavur district, which has led to employment generation, creation of entrepreneurs, and sustainable economic development. The project has transformed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, and villagers are now engaged in various activities such as cultivation, plantations, and food processing. The initiative has also enabled the development of internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products through collaboration with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO). The speaker believes that similar PURA projects are needed across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with a goal of establishing 7000 such projects nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences. Firstly, they met with over 6,000 farmers from various states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed great interest in the different gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasized the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving the economic conditions of the nation through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They also expressed confidence in the nation's ability to increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker recounts a personal experience at a meeting in Coimbatore, where they met a man named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy who was born without hands and legs. Despite his physical limitations, he was radiant and confident. When asked what the speaker could do for him, he replied that he would like to sing in front of them. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of defeating problems and succeeding, using Vidwan's story as an inspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses two examples of overcoming challenges and achieving success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, the speaker shares a personal experience of a physically challenged individual who was encouraged by his parents, teachers, and mentors to pursue his passion for music. Despite his physical limitations, he developed a talent for singing and eventually performed in front of a large audience, including at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker talks about a visit to Urusa village in Jammu and Kashmir, which was affected by the 2005 earthquake. Despite the devastating losses, the villagers had shown remarkable resilience and courage in facing their problems. The speaker was impressed by the villagers' ability to overcome their challenges and become the \"masters of their problems\" rather than allowing the problems to control them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes the importance of positive attitude, perseverance, and partnership in overcoming challenges and achieving success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is about the speaker's experiences with acts of courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and calamities. The speaker shares two specific instances:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In the aftermath of an earthquake, the speaker visited a village where they saw children and villagers bravely participating in relief operations alongside the Armed Forces. The speaker also witnessed the participation of the Acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir and State Government authorities in settling relief grants for victims whose houses were damaged.\n",
      "2. In 2005, the speaker visited the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 Tsunami, where they met with Tribal Council Leaders, Students, and Children of Chuckchucha village. The speaker was moved by the unique characteristic of the islanders, who took in affected victims as their own children and refused to establish orphanages. The speaker composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" to commemorate the occasion, which was sung by the villagers with courage and enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the importance of connectivity and societal transformation in the face of adversity, emphasizing the courage and resilience of ordinary people in the face of natural disasters and calamities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed a Pan African e-Network to connect 53 African countries with a satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network at a cost of $100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, 53 telemedicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers across Africa. A pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine has already been commissioned in Ethiopia, with India's Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to students from Ethiopian universities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the speaker's experiences and achievements in various fields. The speaker mentions that Hyderabad is providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa, in cardiology and radiology since November 2006, and that this is an example of how Indian technology is helping to bring about societal transformation in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also expresses pride in the nation's defense forces, stating that they are ever vigilant and perform their duties beyond the call of duty, even in adverse circumstances. The speaker has had the opportunity to interact with members of the defense forces, para-military forces, and police personnel, and is grateful for their commitment and devotion to duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speaker mentions the \"Youth Movement for Developed India 2020\", a foundation that aims to transform Indian youth into enlightened citizens. The speaker met with a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the importance of empowering India's youth through value-based education and leadership. They highlight the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, specifically mentioning the transformation they've seen in students from Medak district, who have developed self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation. The speaker shares a personal story of a student leader who used the training to encourage her father to stop smoking, giving them confidence that the youth of India are on the right path. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of empowering the country's 540 million youth below the age of 25, who are considered the most powerful resource, through value-based education and leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization for future generations. They highlight the country's progress in the last 60 years, its natural resources, and the hardworking people, particularly the 540 million youth. The speaker expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation by 2020 and encourages people to strive to empower and support each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker outlines five key goals for realizing India's vision of a developed nation by 2020:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reducing the rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Ensuring equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. Synergizing agriculture, industry, and the service sector\n",
      "4. Providing education with a value system to all meritorious students, regardless of societal or economic background\n",
      "5. Becoming a top destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker concludes by quoting a famous poem, \"When You Wish Upon a Star,\" and emphasizes the importance of aiming high and working together to achieve these goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a future nation that is:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Accessible and equitable, with the best healthcare available to all\n",
      "* Governed transparently, responsively, and free from corruption\n",
      "* Free from poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children\n",
      "* Prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy\n",
      "* On a sustainable growth path\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, the speech envisions a nation that is just, prosperous, and fulfilling for all its citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India, expresses gratitude to the citizens of India for their love and support over the past five years. He emphasizes that India is one of the best places to live and is proud of its leadership. He also shares his mission to connect the hearts and minds of the Indian people, instilling self-confidence and the ability to overcome challenges. He concludes by reiterating his commitment to making India a developed nation by 2020 and wishes the citizens God's blessings.\n",

      "President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam delivered a departing speech, thanking the people of India and abroad for the opportunity to serve as President. He highlighted 10 important messages from his five years in office, including the need to accelerate development, empower villages, mobilize rural core competence, and overcome problems through partnership. He shared a personal anecdote about a young girl's question about India becoming a developed nation by 2020, and assured her that it was a thoughtful question and a goal worth striving for. He particularly appreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful one, assuring her that her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and that they would work towards making it a reality. The President's message resonated with the aspirations of the youth, as reflected in the questions and concerns of over 15 lakh young people who represent the dreams of 540 million youth in the nation. He emphasized the importance of empowering villages, citing his own experience in Nagaland, where he saw the positive impact of empowering village councils and providing physical connectivity. He also highlighted the success of the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's PURA (Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas) complex, which has created a sustainable economic development model in 65 villages. The villagers have created employment opportunities, entrepreneurs, and have developed innovative products in collaboration with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO). The President noted that similar PURA complexes are being established in many states and that the whole country needs around 7000 such initiatives to bridge the rural-urban divide.\n",
